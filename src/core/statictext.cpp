    openSource["en"] = "There are a few interesting things to talk about surrounding free and open textbooks. Quality is one. Usability is another. Why to write one (and/or, why not) is certainly critical. But where can you find these disruptive, open texts?\n Not all faculty know there are free and open texts they can use; finding free and/or open textbooks (or even knowing to look) can sometimes be a trick. I knew about one or two sources, and did a little bit more digging. Admittedly, many of the sources of free texts linked below have a technical bent. On one hand, this might be because math, computing, and the sciences are familiar with working openly and giving things away. On the other, it might be because I am a member of the computing faculty, and therefore am most familiar with resources in that space.";
    legal["en"] = "<h1>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEXT</h1><p/><p/>\n\n\n      Legal transactions must originally have been performed by means of speech, often accompanied by rituals of various types.  With the development of literacy, it became possible to make a record of such transactions in writing, or even to transact them in written form.  Indeed, the writing of contracts, wills, and codes of laws was an early function of literacy in many different parts of the world.\n\n\nThe Evolution of Private Legal Texts\n\n      In England, the birthplace of the common law that is used throughout the English-speaking world, an early type of legal text was the will, as well as grants of land and other types of property.  Throughout much of the Anglo-Saxon period, wills and grants of land were made orally, usually with witnesses present, and accompanied by some kind of ritual, such as the symbolic handing over of a clod of dirt to the purchaser or recipient.  After Englands conversion to Christianity, a class of literate clergymen emerged.  Before long, clerics began to make written records of these wills and property transfers as memorials of the transaction, especially when the gift was made to a religious institution that had an interest in preserving evidence of the transaction in case of a future dispute.\n\n      These early texts are quite clearly evidentiary rather than performative or dispositive.  As Brenda Danet and Bryna Bogoch (1994:105) have pointed out, they were \"after-the-fact records of the binding event that already had taken place.\"  In other words, the performance of the legal act did not consist of the writing or the signing or sealing of a piece of paper or document.  The transaction was performed orally in front of witnesses.  If a written document was made, it was merely evidence of that oral ceremony, not an operative or dispositive legal document in the modern sense.  This is evident from the fact that for the most part, the scribes used verbs that were in the third person and the past tense, rather than the first person, present tense verbs that are commonly used performatively, as the following introductory phrase illustrates:\n\n\nHER is geswutelod an ðis gewrite hu Ælfheah ealdorman his cwidæ gecwæðan hæfð...\n\n\nHere in this document it is declared how the ealdorman Ælfheah has declared his will... (Will of Ælfheah, Whitelock 1930:22-23)\n\n\n      In the late Anglo-Saxon period, however, there are indications of a new trend in which legal texts were no longer merely evidence of land transfers or wills.  Over the centuries, it became the writing and signing of the document (or placing a seal on it) that constituted the legally operative or dispositive act.  The legal transaction was now performed by means of the text.\n\n      The transition in the function of wills was a very gradual process.  When wills were first written down, the text was considered rather weak evidence of the transaction that it purported to record.  Human memory was viewed as more reliable and less subject to manipulation.  But as literacy became more common, the evidentiary value of the text increased.  Over time, the notion arose that legal transactions-especially, important transactions-should normally be evidenced by a writing.  Eventually, a written text came to be considered an essential ingredient of the transaction.  The English Statute of Wills, enacted in 1540, required that transfers of real property by will should be evidenced by a writing. Later English statutes extended the requirement of writing to transfers of personal property upon death.   As a result, written evidence of a will was now essential.\n\n      The final critical development in the testamentary text was the parol evidence rule, which in the case of wills prohibits the introduction of evidence of oral discussions regarding the content of the text, subject to some narrow exceptions.  Thus, what the maker of the will (usually called the testator) might have said to the lawyer who drafted the will, or what he might have said to anyone else about the contents of the will, became largely irrelevant.  The evolution from oral to written transaction was now complete, at least with respect to the law of wills.  What mattered now was solely the written text.  That text was not just the best evidence of the legal transaction.  It was not just the only evidence.  At this stage, the text had become the transaction.   A modern will is a specific type of legal text that is taken as the definitive expression of the testamentary intentions of its maker.\n\n       The development of English wills is a good illustration of how legal texts are introduced into a culture.  In the beginning, such texts are almost always evidentiary, serving as nothing more than records of an oral transaction.  Yet the text can also become authoritative, as have wills in the past few centuries.  The same is true of another common legal text, the deed, which is used to convey real property.  With wills and deeds, the transaction in question can only be performed by properly enacting written text.";
